bisect left: Finds the insertion point for an element to maintain a sorted order, preferring 
the leftmost position if the element already exists
    - Use Case: When you need to insert an element before existing eleemnts of the same value
    - Behavior: Returns the first index where the element is not less than the given value

Ex: 
arr = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4]
x = 2
index = bisect.bisect_left(arr, x) -> 1
