For cyclic lists, hare and tortoise will point to the same node after F+C-h iterations, 
as demonstrated in the proof of correctness. F+C-h â‰¤F+C=n, so phase 1 runs in O(n) time. Phase 2 runs for F < n
iterations, so it also runs in O(n) time.

For acyclic lists, hare will reach the end of the list in roughly n/2 iterations, causing the function to return before phase 2. Therefore, regardless of which category of list the algorithm receives, it runs in time linearly proportional to the number of nodes.
